# Project overview

The objective of this project is to analyze the spectral respone and wave forms of the rugate filters for differnt wavelengths.

# How to run the program

The Rugate_filter.ipynb is the jupyter notebook that contains the use of myTMM.py code. The  myTMM.py code is the framework of the Transfer Matrix Method for multilayer filter. It is inspired from the documentation of the "tmm" module in python designed by Steven Byrnes. Please see these references for details.

Clone the repository and use the jupyter notebook to run this program.
