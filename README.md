# Project overview

Write a program to calculate the waveform for rugate filters for arbitrary wavelengths and filter shapes.

See this for the general idea:

# How to run the program

The Rugate_filter.ipynb is the jupyter notebook that contains the use of myTMM.py code. The  myTMM.py code is the framework of the Transfer Matrix Method for multilayer filter. It is inspired from the documentation of the "tmm" module in python designed by Steven Byrnes. Please see these references for details.

The tmm documentation: https://pythonhosted.org/tmm/index.html

The paper by Steven Byrnes: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.02720.pdf

Visit the wiki page for the physics and derivation of the rugate filters and TMM implementation.
